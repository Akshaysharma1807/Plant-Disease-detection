This project involves building a Potato Disease Classification System using deep learning to automatically identify whether a potato leaf is healthy, or affected by Early Blight or Late Blight diseases. Here’s an explanation of how it works in simpler terms:

**Overview of the Project:**

Goal: Automatically classify potato leaf images into one of three categories: Early Blight, Late Blight, or Healthy using a deep learning model.

Dataset: The model is trained on a dataset of potato leaf images that belong to these three classes.

Steps Involved:

Data Collection: The dataset of potato leaves is loaded using TensorFlow’s image_dataset_from_directory() function, where images are labeled based on their folder structure.
The images are divided into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure the model learns correctly and can be evaluated for accuracy.

Data Preprocessing: Images are resized to 256x256 pixels, and their pixel values are scaled between 0 and 1 (normalization) to help the model learn more efficiently.
Data augmentation techniques like random flips and rotations are used to make the model more robust to variations in the images.

Building the Model: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used, which is ideal for image classification tasks.
The model consists of multiple convolutional layers that learn to identify features in the images, followed by max-pooling layers that reduce the size of these features.
The final layer uses a softmax activation to predict which class (Early Blight, Late Blight, or Healthy) the leaf belongs to.

Training the Model: The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and SparseCategoricalCrossentropy as the loss function, which is suitable for multi-class classification.
It is trained for 50 epochs, during which the model’s accuracy improves as it learns from the training data.

Evaluating the Model: After training, the model is evaluated on the test dataset, achieving an accuracy of around 97%. This means it can correctly classify 97 out of 100 leaf images.
A confusion matrix is created to analyze how well the model performs across different classes and to spot any weaknesses (e.g., if it confuses one disease for another).
Predictions:

The model can predict the class of a new, unseen potato leaf image, along with its confidence in the prediction (i.e., how sure it is about the result).

**Tech Stack:**

Python: Main programming language.

TensorFlow/Keras: Used for building, training, and evaluating the neural network.

OpenCV and PIL: For image processing.

FastAPI: Web framework for deploying the model as an API, where users can upload images and get predictions.
